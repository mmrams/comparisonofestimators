Using three different datagenerating processes, I compare the OLS to the Doubly Robust estimator under a causal framework.

In case one, the OLS outperforms the Doubly Robust under a homoscedastic data generating process.
In case two, the Doubly Robust estimator outperforms the OLS under a heteroscedastic data generating process.
In case three, both estimators fail due to one confounder being missing which violates the CIA assumption.
